         How to find the file in github
         How to change the file, cause I fork the wrong place.
         How to push and pull in the right place

I understand the meaning of "print" and it should with bracket,if there are words in bracket, it will use " ".
if it use number in bracket, it will be fine.
For example:
            1. print(" "):print what you want
            2. print(number+number):print the answer
            3. print(""" 
                     """):print whay you want and it show the layout as what you like
