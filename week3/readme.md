1. I know the loops function
2. For b < (4 - a), do not forget the brackers
3. The loops about range loops and while loops, range is limit loops, but the while is infinite loops.
4. For the loops, we need create a list first.
5. In the exercise 4, I tried to fix the guess number, but the debug works, terminal not. I think I should combine binary search with while loops.
6. I know the "binary search" is that guess a number to compare with midterm number in the list, 
   mid = (low + high) // 2
